        <p>The reason you are reading this today, is because i googled the phrase <em>“The JavaScript landscape”</em>. I was trying to reseach the various tools/frameworks in JavaScript for different concerns. Google returned a bunch of results of which i chose this <a href="http://www.axelerant.com/blog/javascript-and-future-development-landscape" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>JavaScipt and future development landscape</em></a>. </p>
<p>It’s a blog post by an Indian kid called <code>Bassam</code>. I liked the post. It discussed <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>Meteor</code></a>, his app <a href="http://writ.bassam.co/" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>Writ</code></a>, an application to create notes in Markdown, with live previews on the side. It’s open sourced and on <a href="https://github.com/skippednote/writ" target="_blank" rel="external">github</a>. Okay, navigating through the various links, i found out that this kid is 22 and he if from Kashmir. I was impressed. This kid was doing things i was doing and even more. </p>
<p>In his post, however i found a link to a <strong><code>John Resig&#39;s</code></strong> post, <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>Write Code Everyday</code></a>. John, in his post mentions how he set aside rules for himself to write code as a habit. It’s a very inspiring read. What’s even inspiring is John is himself inspired by a lady. <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>Jennifer Dewalt</code></a>.</p>
<p>Jennifer Dewalt, taught herself how to program and how to do web development by developing 1 website a day, for 180 days. She recorded her progress each day on her <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">blog</a>.</p>
<p>From a post, <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/81451670618/my-first-year-of-coding" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>My first year of coding</code></a>on her blog, these are her words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I finished my website for the first day of the 180 websites project I was incredibly proud. I knew I had a lot of hard work ahead of me, but I had overcome what is often the largest hurdle in any project: getting started.</p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot about myself in the past year working on both the 180 websites project</p>
<p>Most importantly, I’ve been able to overcome the fear of being judged. Whether you are making a piece of artwork, teaching yourself something new or building a business you’re bound to encounter some negative energy. People will say some pretty weird or just plain mean things to you when you’re doing something kind of crazy. Those comments sting a bit, but they’re most dangerous when you let them feed your self doubt. Battling your own self doubt is incredibly formidable.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you go! A young lady who has shown the world the power of habit, her determination to learn something new and her awesome positive energy. Her energy has influenced one of the World’s most respected and most reknowned software engineer, John Resig and he has learnt from her. It’s not surprising. Whenever a lot of positive energy radiates, people will be influenced. And they will react. Their best will come out. </p>
<p>I am inspired by this positive wave: Jennifer Dewalt =&gt; John Resig =&gt; 22 year old Bassam. The positive energy has flown. I do not know how many other people Jennifer has had an effect on. She certain has had an effect on me. I have thouroughly enjoyed the learning experience from a simple Google search. I actually went to think about <code>The power of habit</code> and create my own thoughts on that.</p>
<p><code>To Code Everyday</code> is my new found choice of habit. I just need to inculcate it. I need to practice it. At a high-level, it seems daunting. I immediately have a lot of “What-if” questions. I code at work, but like Resig, working n my own stuff. It’s certainly hard. But as Jennifer correctly noted, </p>

        <p>On the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>HarryPotter wiki</em></a>, the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Patronus" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>Patronus charm</code></a> is described as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Patronus Charm (Expecto Patronum) is the most famous and one of the most powerful<br>defensive charms known to wizardkind.It’s an immensely complicated, very difficult<br>spell that evokes a partially-tangible positive energy force known as a Patronus<br>or spirit guardian. It is the primary protection against Dementors and Lethifolds,<br>to which there is no other protection.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Patronus Charm is a very powerful spell. It’s a positive spell to ward off<br><code>Dementors</code>. Dementors in the Harry Potter series are vicious guardians of the<br>prison at <code>Azkaban</code>. To go to Azkaban is described as something close to hell.<br>Dementors suck the life out of you! Everything goes cold. It’s painful.</p>
<p>Such a great analogy <code>J K Rowling</code> has made with life! Every day many people are<br>bothered by such dementors in daily life. Energy is sucked out of us by constant<br>worry about relationships, money, disease, death, expectations and so much more.<br>People are bothered by continous negativity! Negative people, negative talk,<br>negative environments.</p>
<p>I have had an amazing life! Mostly so because of the people in my life. I<br>attribute a lot of happiness, freedom, free thinking, peace to my family! They have<br>been my life teachers. Principles of love, kindness, peace, truth have been<br>poured into my soul by them. Friends whose vibrant energy and constant love have<br>made me who I am. They are incessantly after me to grow better and stronger and<br>continously teach me the ways of life. Teachers have had a great impact!<br>Teachers at school, family and friends, friends at work, these awesome teachers,<br>have shaped me in to being Sameeri.</p>
<p>Each day is a new learning experience! The last one year has been a unique<br>challenge! I had been under constant pressure. I would be depressed, feel alone,<br>radiate a lot of negative energy for myself and others. My relationships would<br>suffer because of this. Awkwardness would creep in. Loss of trust, worrying<br>about people, their words, their actions would hurt me. Until one day, I<br>couldn’t take it any longer! What happened? What has happened to the beautiful<br>heart of Sameeri? Why did Sameeri let things go so bad! </p>
<p>At one point of time, I felt I needed a psychologist or a psychiatrist to talk<br>to. So one day, I sat down. I had time. All I had in life at this point was me<br>and time. Nothing else. A couple of days earlier I had the opportunity to talk<br>to my brother, <code>Sasya</code>, one of the very best souls I can always depend on. I told him<br>about these thoughts. I told him, “I had not done anything this last one year.<br>Nothing at all, but let myself slip into negativity”. He said : <em>“Well, You have traveled,<br>had quality time with your friends and worked out, got youself into a better shape,<br>did great at work, and did so much more.”</em> He brought out just a positive thought<br>in the midst of my sorrow. I was thinking all of this at a Starbucks in Tulsa.<br>The day before, i had the opportunity to go to the Tulsa tech. conference. I<br>had been motivated by the talks and that caused my introspection as well. </p>
<p>So I asked myself. What’s wrong with me? And I came to the conclusion that<br>nothing at all. Everything was fine. It’s just that for a moment in life I just<br>let myself slip into negativity. I had to come back. But it’s so difficult.<br>The dementors of my mind have grown stronger, and had control over me. I had no<br>knowledge of the Patronus charm. Harry Potter, his friends had to practice the<br>Patronus charm a lot. It’s a difficult spell to practice. To get out of the<br>clutch of the dementors, you have to focus on the most brightest, happiest<br>moments in life. We have to practice hard. To get out of negativity is not easy!<br>But a spell exists. That of positive energy. J K Rowling put “Dementors” as the<br>negative stuff that bothers us each day! The way out then is of extreme<br>positivity! It’s the only way out. <code>Positive energy is healing</code>. You listen to<br>music, play a guitar, paint, run, play tennis or do whatever makes you happy<br>and it will bring in positive energy. The energy that you need.</p>
<p>It’s tough when the dementors are super strong. Instances of friends performing<br>the Patronus charm when harry was in trouble to save him are known to us.<br>Sometimes our positivity and enery help ohters around us. The whole universe is<br>running on energy. The human world works on positive energy! People burning<br>their energy positively make this world go! Energy is vital! Burning energy in<br>the positive way is what is so crucial to me and my life! I have to practice the<br>Patronus charm. It’s important because I’m just a human being and it’s very<br>easy for me to go negative. I’m going to tap into the most vital energy of the<br>universe, that of God’s, to help me out. And i have also come up the animal that pops<br>out of my Patrnus charm, an <code>Elephant</code>.</p>
