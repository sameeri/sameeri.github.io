On the [*HarryPotter wiki*](http://harrypotter.wikia.com), the [`Patronous charm`](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Patronus) is described as :
>"The Patronus Charm (Expecto Patronum) is the most famous and one of the most powerful 
defensive charms known to wizardkind.It's an immensely complicated, very difficult 
spell that evokes a partially-tangible positive energy force known as a Patronus 
or spirit guardian. It is the primary protection against Dementors and Lethifolds, 
to which there is no other protection."

The Patronus Charm is a very powerful spell. It's a positive spell to ward off
Dementors. Dementors in the Harry Potter series are vicious guardians of the
prison at Azkaban. To go to Azkaban is described as something close to hell.
Dementors suck the life out of you! Everything goes cold. It's painful.

Such a great analogy J K Rowling has made with life! Every day many people are
bothered by such dementors in daily life. Energy is sucked out of us by constant
worry about relationships, money, disease, death, expectations and so much more.
People are bothered by continous negativity! Negative people, negative talk,
negative environments.

I have had an amazing life! Mostly so because of the people in my life. I
attribute a lot of happiness, freedom, free thinking, peace to my family! They have
been my life teachers. Principles of love, kindness, peace, truth have been
poured into my soul by them. Friends whose vibrant energy and constant love have
made me who I am. They are incessantly after me to grow better and stronger and
continously teach me the ways of life. Teachers have had a great impact!
Teachers at school, family and friends, friends at work, these awesome teachers, 
have shaped me in to being Sameeri.

Each day is a new learning experience! The last one year has been a unique
challenge! I had been under constant pressure. I would be depressed, feel alone,
radiate a lot of negative energy for myself and others. My relationships would
suffer because of this. Awkwardness would creep in. Loss of trust, worrying
about people, their words, their actions would hurt me. Until one day, I
couldn't take it any longer! What happened? What has happened to the beautiful
heart of Sameeri? Why did Sameeri let things go so bad!Â 

At one point of time, I felt I needed a psychologist or a psychiatrist to talk
to. So one day, I sat down. I had time. All I had in life at this point was me
and time. Nothing else. A couple of days earlier I had the opportunity to talk
to my brother, one of the very best souls I can always depend on. I told him
about these thoughts. I told him I had not done anything this last one year.
Nothing at all, but let myself slip into negativity. He said : "Well, You have traveled,
had quality time with your friends and worked out, got youself into a better shape,
did great at work, and did so much more." He brought out just a positive thought 
in the midst of my sorrow. I was thinking all of this at a Starbucks in Tulsa. 
The day before, i had the opportunity to go to the Tulsa tech. conference. I
had been motivated by the talks and that caused my introspection as well. 

So I asked myself. What's wrong with me? And I came to the conclusion that 
nothing at all. Everything was fine. It's just that for a moment in life I just
let myself slip into negativity. I had to come back. But it's so difficult.
The dementors of my mind have grown stronger, and had control over me. I had no
knowledge of the Patronous charm. Harry Potter, his friends had to practice the
Patronous charm a lot. It's a difficult spell to practice. To get out of the
clutch of the dementors, you have to focus on the most brightest, happiest
moments in life. We have to practice hard. To get out of negativity is not easy!
But a spell exists. That of positive energy. J K Rowling put "Dementors" as the
negative stuff that bothers us each day! The way out then is of extreme
positivity! It's the only way out. Positive energy is healing. You listen to
music, play a guitar, paint, run, play tennis or do whatever makes you happy 
and it will bring in positive energy. The energy that you need.

It's tough when the dementors are super strong. Instances of friends performing
the Patronous charm when harry was in trouble to save him are known to us.
Sometimes our positivity and enery help ohters around us. The whole universe is
running on energy. The human world works on positive energy! People burning
their energy positively make this world go! Energy is vital! Burning energy in
the positive way is what is so crucial to me and my life! I have to practice the
Patronous charm. It's important because I'm just a human being and it's very
easy for me to go negative. I'm going to tap into the most vital energy of the
universe, that of God's, to help me out.
