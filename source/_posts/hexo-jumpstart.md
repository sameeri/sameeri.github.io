I have a blog, [Whack-Whack](http://www.whack-whack.info) up on Blogger. However, the recent hexo love from Jesse, 
has inspired me and i also see how easy it is to take my texts out and write some **markdown** and deploy 
it to github.**Hexo** is a great tool. It's [open sourced on github](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) and i want to use it's awesomeness. 

This is the very first post created by [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), when you run the
**hexo new "post name"** command. I'm going to leave the simple steps included in the post.
