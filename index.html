        <p>Sai baba vinayakaya namaha!</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>HarryPotter wiki</em></a>, the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Patronus" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>Patronous charm</code></a> is described as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Patronus Charm (Expecto Patronum) is the most famous and one of the most powerful<br>defensive charms known to wizardkind.It’s an immensely complicated, very difficult<br>spell that evokes a partially-tangible positive energy force known as a Patronus<br>or spirit guardian. It is the primary protection against Dementors and Lethifolds,<br>to which there is no other protection.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Patronus Charm is a very powerful spell. It’s a positive spell to ward off<br>Dementors. Dementors in the Harry Potter series are vicious guardians of the<br>prison at Azkaban. To go to Azkaban is described as something close to hell.<br>Dementors suck the life out of you! Everything goes cold. It’s painful.</p>
<p>Such a great analogy J K Rowling has made with life! Every day many people are<br>bothered by such dementors in daily life. Energy is sucked out of us by constant<br>worry about relationships, money, disease, death, expectations and so much more.<br>People are bothered by continous negativity! Negative people, negative talk,<br>negative environments.</p>
<p>I have had an amazing life! Mostly so because of the people in my life. I<br>attribute a lot of happiness, freedom, free thinking, peace to my family! They have<br>been my life teachers. Principles of love, kindness, peace, truth have been<br>poured into my soul by them. Friends whose vibrant energy and constant love have<br>made me who I am. They are incessantly after me to grow better and stronger and<br>continously teach me the ways of life. Teachers have had a great impact!<br>Teachers at school, family and friends, friends at work, these awesome teachers,<br>have shaped me in to being Sameeri.</p>
<p>Each day is a new learning experience! The last one year has been a unique<br>challenge! I had been under constant pressure. I would be depressed, feel alone,<br>radiate a lot of negative energy for myself and others. My relationships would<br>suffer because of this. Awkwardness would creep in. Loss of trust, worrying<br>about people, their words, their actions would hurt me. Until one day, I<br>couldn’t take it any longer! What happened? What has happened to the beautiful<br>heart of Sameeri? Why did Sameeri let things go so bad! </p>
<p>At one point of time, I felt I needed a psychologist or a psychiatrist to talk<br>to. So one day, I sat down. I had time. All I had in life at this point was me<br>and time. Nothing else. A couple of days earlier I had the opportunity to talk<br>to my brother, one of the very best souls I can always depend on. I told him<br>about these thoughts. I told him I had not done anything this last one year.<br>Nothing at all, but let myself slip into negativity. He said : “Well, You have traveled,<br>had quality time with your friends and worked out, got youself into a better shape,<br>did great at work, and did so much more.” He brought out just a positive thought<br>in the midst of my sorrow. I was thinking all of this at a Starbucks in Tulsa.<br>The day before, i had the opportunity to go to the Tulsa tech. conference. I<br>had been motivated by the talks and that caused my introspection as well. </p>
<p>So I asked myself. What’s wrong with me? And I came to the conclusion that<br>nothing at all. Everything was fine. It’s just that for a moment in life I just<br>let myself slip into negativity. I had to come back. But it’s so difficult.<br>The dementors of my mind have grown stronger, and had control over me. I had no<br>knowledge of the Patronous charm. Harry Potter, his friends had to practice the<br>Patronous charm a lot. It’s a difficult spell to practice. To get out of the<br>clutch of the dementors, you have to focus on the most brightest, happiest<br>moments in life. We have to practice hard. To get out of negativity is not easy!<br>But a spell exists. That of positive energy. J K Rowling put “Dementors” as the<br>negative stuff that bothers us each day! The way out then is of extreme<br>positivity! It’s the only way out. Positive energy is healing. You listen to<br>music, play a guitar, paint, run, play tennis or do whatever makes you happy<br>and it will bring in positive energy. The energy that you need.</p>
<p>It’s tough when the dementors are super strong. Instances of friends performing<br>the Patronous charm when harry was in trouble to save him are known to us.<br>Sometimes our positivity and enery help ohters around us. The whole universe is<br>running on energy. The human world works on positive energy! People burning<br>their energy positively make this world go! Energy is vital! Burning energy in<br>the positive way is what is so crucial to me and my life! I have to practice the<br>Patronous charm. It’s important because I’m just a human being and it’s very<br>easy for me to go negative. I’m going to tap into the most vital energy of the<br>universe, that of God’s, to help me out.</p>
