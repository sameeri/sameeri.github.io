        <p>Sometime in February, i started working out. I was feeling lonely and i had to burn my energy and not think about my friends and miss them. <code>Madhu bhai</code> and <code>buss</code> asked me to start taking care of myself. So, I started out following the <code>Power 90 Sculpt 1-2 module</code>. I had two 10 pound dumbbells. So each morning, i would get up and try to follow this video running on my 60” tv. I wieghed around 182-184 pounds. But my intention was not to lose weight or anything. It was “I am missing all awesome friends. I have to stop thinking about them, and do something else.” That was the motivation.</p>
<p>After a week, i felt good. I liked the 35 minute procedure. I loved <strong>Tony Horton</strong>. I asked myself, Well, i’m not doing anything productive in the evenings. How about trying out the Cardio part <code>Sweat 1-2</code> module. The first day i did the program, i was totally in love with it. Yeah, the first couple of days, i was sore, but i enjoyed it. Soon i was working out in the mornings and the evenings. And i had a sense of accomplishment each day.</p>
<p>Around March, <code>Peach</code> told me to check weight and keep that as a motivation factor. And <code>Ray</code> started pouring in health knowledge, at work. Healthy nutrition and things like that. He made my buy a <code>Fitbit</code> device and asked me to start recording my daily consumption of food at <code>MyFitnessPal</code>. I started doing that.Soon, <code>Sundeep</code> asked me to start eating breakfast. I started grabbing a spinach wrap from Starbucks. I started trying out brown rice. I had fallen into other habits thanks to the first one.</p>
<p>In April, we had a get-together in Kansas and then one in St.Louis. Kids from Kansas were surprised as how fast i had lost weight and were soon wanting to do the things i wanted to do. It made me happy. </p>
<p>By May, i was down to 155 pounds and i looked super slim. I had grown out of an L to an M. And then, i had a stack of trips i had planned and i was to travel everywhere. When you travel, it’s hard to workout. And the habit breaks down. It’s a great level of discomfort for the body and the soul however. If you don’t do a thing that you have been doing each day, your body is not happy. It could be anything. Workout, coffee, nicotine.. whatever. So due to travel i had a break in my daily routine. After a couple of months, i tried to go back to my schedule. It was super difficult.</p>
<p>So i learnt two different things. The <code>power of habit</code>, and that <code>habits can break</code>. When you do a thing each day,one day it becomes natural. It becomes a part of you. The thing could have a positive influence on you, giving you great energy. Or it could be causing an indirect negative influence on you, like say nicotine. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To <strong>start</strong> doing something daily, is the most difficult part of it. But when you get going, you gonna rock it up! To start a habit, you have to keep yourself motivated.</p>
